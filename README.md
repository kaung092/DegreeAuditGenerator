This web application generate student degree audit based on class information entered. 
The system currently in use at CUNY does not create degree audit, which resulted in manual tasks for advisors across academic departments 
whenever they need to check a student's graduation status.


This web application solved the issue by:
1. Parsing student class information
2. Checking it against appropriate curriculum
3. Generating formatted degree audit in excel.

This application is currenlty in use by advisors of Electrical Engineering department at City College of New York.

Future expansion include:
1. Integrating more curriculums
2. Creating user interface to customize curriculums (accessible by program advisors of each department)
3. Calculating QPA, and projected GPA etc.
